#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I was still getting into the habit of adding and committing each file when I made changes.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* My pair and I were able to clarify the git fetch and merge commands, which neither of us had done before

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* I asked my pair questions on how to resolve a merge conflict and how to properly push a feature branch to Github.

#What still confuses you about Git?

* I still need practice on keeping clarity on branches and changes made and on how to make sure I am only working off the most recent changes available in Github.

*

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
