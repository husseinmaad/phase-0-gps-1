* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Actually i don't have any struggling prior the GPS session i just had some questions and we discuss about it during the session.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

we clarified how to use the git and github workflow and also we discuss about the commands line the been used to implement this challenge

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Actually i asked about the merge conflict and i also asked the GPS about one of the challenges it was little bit confusing me.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

Not really every thing seems clear to me but i am little bit carousing about the fetch and merge.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Actually it was good either we miss our guide because she came late for emergency reason but it was good and hopefully it will be batter next week.
